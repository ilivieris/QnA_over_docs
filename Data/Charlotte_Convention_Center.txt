The Charlotte Convention Center is a convention center located in Charlotte, North Carolina. It opened in 1995 and attracts more than half a million visitors each year.[1] It was designed by Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback & Associates (TVS).

It has 280,000 square feet (26,000 m2) of contiguous exhibit space. The ballroom spans 35,000 square feet (3,300 m2) with banquet seating for up to 1,800 guests. Pre-function areas extend the ballroom space by 15,000 square feet (1,400 m2). There is also more than 90,000 square feet (8,000 m2) of flexible meeting space in 46 rooms.

The LYNX and the now defunct Charlotte Trolley lines pass straight through the center of the convention center. The convention center was recently expanded to include an additional ballroom since the NASCAR Hall of Fame is connected to the convention center.

In April 2017, the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority announced a $110-million expansion to the convention center. The expansion will increase the meeting space by 50,000 square feet and add a bridge for pedestrians linking the center to the Westin Hotel nearby. The project was expected to start construction in early 2019.[2]
